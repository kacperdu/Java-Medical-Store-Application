# Java-Medical-Store-Application
A JavaFX-based desktop application that simulates the operations of a medical store.
The project follows an MVC architecture with DAO and DTO layers, integrating an SQL database for managing inventory, products, orders, and customers.

Features:
- Customer account registration and login
- Product management (add, remove, update, view inventory)
- Order and purchase handling
- SQL-backed data persistence
- GUI interface built with JavaFX
- Modular structure with Controllers, Models, Views, DTOs, and DAOs

Tech Stack:
- Java (JavaFX) – GUI development
- SQL – Database management
- IntelliJ IDEA – Development environment
- MVC Pattern – Organized architecture

Structure:
- Controllers handle user interactions (e.g., LoginController, OrderController)
- Models represent business logic (e.g., Customer, Product, Order)
- Views handle JavaFX UI components (e.g., LoginView, OrderView)
- DAOs handle database operations (e.g., CustomerDAO, ProductDAO)
- DTOs handle data transfer objects (CustomerDTO, ProductDTO)
- Main handle entry point of the application (Main.java)
